An online marketplace built with Ruby on Rails where space enthusiasts can buy and sell intergalactic vehicles, such as starships, droids, and more.

## üìñ Overview
This project is a full-featured web application that simulates an e-commerce platform. Users can register, list their own products (spaceships), browse listings from others, add items to a shopping cart, and complete a purchase. The application was built following Ruby on Rails best practices, featuring a secure authentication system, relational database management, and a reactive user interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **User Authentication**: A complete user registration and login system using the `Devise` gem.
- **Product Management (CRUD)**: Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their own vehicle listings.
- **Multiple Image Uploads**: Integration with `Cloudinary` and `Active Storage` to allow multiple photos per product.
- **Product Search and Filtering**: Functionality to search for products by name and filter by category, enhancing the Browse experience.
- **Shopping Cart**: A session-based shopping cart system, allowing users to add and remove items before checkout.
- **Checkout Flow**: A checkout page where users can review their order, enter shipping information, and confirm their purchase.
- **Security and Authorization**: The system ensures that users can only manage the products they have created.
