  <%# 1. INTRODUÇÃO %>
  <h2 class="text-center">Welcome to SpaceTraders - The Universe's Marketplace!</h2>
  <p class="about-intro">
    Here at GalacticTrade, we believe the universe is far too vast to stand still.
    That's why we connect buyers and sellers from across all star systems, offering the largest variety of spaceships,
    intelligent droids, and advanced vehicles for all your intergalactic adventures.
    Whether you're exploring distant nebulas, braving sandstorms on Tatooine,
    or simply need a droid that can fix your ship while brewing your morning coffee, we've got you covered.

    <h3 class="text-center">What Do We Offer?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>🚀 Spaceships for Every Journey</h4>
        <p>
          From battle cruisers to sleek starships for quick getaways, find new,
          used, and even slightly “acquired” options here (we promise, only from dishonest space merchants).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>🤖 Smart and Functional Droids</h4>
        <p>
          Need a translator fluent em over 6 million languages? Or a security droid to
          guard your freighter while you rest? We've got them all. Just don't ask them to do laundry—still working on that feature.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>🚗 Advanced Vehicles for Extreme Terrain</h4>
        <p>
          Whether gliding over Jakku's dunes or scaling icy peaks on a frozen planet, we have the perfect ride for any biome
          (even the ones yet to be descobertos).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <%# 3. SEÇÃO FINAL (NOTA) %>
  <div class="about-section">
    <p class="about-note">
      If you find a spaceship described as having a "durable frame", just know it's code for "needs a few repairs". And if a seller offers you a droid that talks too much, remember: no returns on overloaded memory units! 😉
